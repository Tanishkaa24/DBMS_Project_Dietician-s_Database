# DBMS_Project_Dietician-s_Database

The database addressed in our project is that of a Dietician healthcare agency that is run in two branches,
Bandra and Vile Parle. The dieticians are allocated to the different branches and their fees are dependent on
the experience of the dietician. The dietician agency has to coordinate with customers, dieticians, vendors
and hospitals in order to successfully run their agency.
The dieticians are appointed and paid a salary based on their experience and they decide the meal chart of
their customers. Customers experience different issues which can be helped by providing a diet suited for
it. The vendors are those stores that will help to provide the meals as per their meal chart. We can run
specific searches to provide the customers with vendors that are near their location.
The food groups are divided on the basis of the nutrient it specializes in and each consists of combinations
of carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, proteins and fibers. These food groups are then used to decide
breakfast, lunch and dinner. The meal chart then consists of combinations of breakfast, lunch and dinner
and is decided on the basis of the condition faced by the customer. The permutations and combinations of
these are stored in the databases as per the suggestions of the dietician.
Before prescribing a particular diet, the customer has to undertake a blood test and also book an
appointment with the dietician who will study these blood test results. Specific searches can be performed
by the dietician to detect any anomalies in the customerâ€™s blood which helps to note the nutrients that they
lack and can be compensated by the suggested meal plan.
The customer pays for the dietician services in installments which is recorded in a different table with the
details of payment recorded duly.
